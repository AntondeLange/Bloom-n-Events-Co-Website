              Bloom'n Events Co. began in 2018 under the original name The Ridge Retreat & Health Gardens, delivering creative, nature-based workshops for children, teens, and adults.

              We've worked across Perth, from Midland Gate's Fresh Food Precinct to seasonal activations at Belmont Forum, Stockland Baldivis and City of Swan's Avon Descent Festival. One highlight was the 12-day "Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle" programme, drawing families back with rotating sustainability activities. Post-COVID, we've re-emerged more focused and driven—ready to transform WA spaces through connection, creativity, and community.
